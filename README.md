***Lunarvim config***
This is a first stab at using more of a supported neovim config via Lunarvim

The only files/folders I should really be concerned with are:
- `config.lua`
  - This is what Lunarvim provides by default as an entry point for customizing settings to use/turn off or modify core plugins
- `lua/`
  - In this folder, I'll provide all my customizations in a modular format for tidiness and to add any other non-core plugins I need
